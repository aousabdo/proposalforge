3. **Efficiency Gain**: Time to produce proposal drafts is reduced by at least 30% compared to current process
4. **Feedback Quality**: Users provide specific, actionable feedback that informs Enterprise version priorities
5. **Technical Foundation**: Architecture supports path to Enterprise version without significant refactoring
6. **Performance Standards**: All performance requirements are met under normal operating conditions

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize MVP User Stories**: Confirm final priorities for Phase 1 implementation
2. **Create Development Sprints**: Organize user stories into logical work packages
3. **Define UI/UX Requirements**: Develop wireframes for key user flows
4. **Establish Testing Criteria**: Define test cases for each user story
5. **Develop Feedback Mechanisms**: Create structured approach to capturing user feedback
