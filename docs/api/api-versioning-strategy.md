# ProposalForge API Versioning Strategy

## Introduction

This document outlines the versioning strategy for the ProposalForge API, providing guidelines for managing API changes while maintaining backward compatibility. A well-defined versioning strategy is critical for ensuring a smooth evolution of the API as ProposalForge grows from MVP to Enterprise.

## Versioning Principles

ProposalForge API versioning follows these core principles:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: New versions should not break existing client integrations when possible
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: New features should be additive where possible
3. **Clear Communication**: Version changes and migrations must be clearly communicated
4. **Reasonable Transitions**: Adequate time for migration between versions must be provided
5. **Controlled Rollout**: New versions should be rolled out gradually to minimize risk

## Versioning Scheme

### URL Path Versioning

ProposalForge uses URL path versioning as the primary versioning mechanism:

```
https://api.proposalforge.com/v1/workspaces
```

This approach offers several benefits:
- Simple and explicit version identification
- Easy to understand and implement
- Compatible with caching strategies
- Clearly visible in logs and monitoring

### Version Format

Version numbers follow the format `vX` where X is a major version number:

- `v1`: Initial API version
- `v2`: Second major version with breaking changes
- etc.

We do not include minor versions in the URL path to maintain simplicity.

### Version Lifecycle

Each API version goes through the following lifecycle stages:

1. **Preview**: Early access for testing, subject to change
2. **Active**: Stable, fully supported version
3. **Deprecated**: Still functional but scheduled for retirement
4. **Retired**: No longer available or supported

Versions will remain in the "Active" state for a minimum of 12 months after the release of a newer version.

## Managing API Changes

### Non-breaking Changes

The following changes are considered non-breaking and can be made without incrementing the major version:

1. **Adding new endpoints**
2. **Adding optional request parameters**
3. **Adding new fields to response objects**
4. **Adding new error codes**
5. **Relaxing validation rules**
6. **Extending enum values**
7. **Performance improvements with identical behavior**
8. **Adding or improving documentation**
9. **Expanding rate limits**

### Breaking Changes

The following changes are considered breaking and require a new major version:

1. **Removing or renaming endpoints**
2. **Removing or renaming fields**
3. **Changing field types or formats**
4. **Adding required request parameters**
5. **Changing the structure of request or response objects**
6. **Changing authentication mechanisms**
7. **Changing error response formats**
8. **Changing the semantics of an existing parameter**
9. **Reducing rate limits**
10. **Removing support for previously valid inputs**

### Handling Deprecation

When functionality needs to be deprecated:

1. **Mark as Deprecated**: Use response headers to indicate deprecation
   ```
   Deprecation: true
   Sunset: Sat, 31 Dec 2023 23:59:59 GMT
   Link: <https://api.proposalforge.com/v2/workspaces>; rel="successor-version"
   ```

2. **Documentation**: Clearly mark deprecated features in the API documentation

3. **Warning Responses**: Include deprecation warnings in responses
   ```json
   {
     "data": { ... },
     "warnings": [
       {
         "code": "deprecated_endpoint",
         "message": "This endpoint is deprecated and will be removed on 2023-12-31. Please migrate to /v2/workspaces.",
         "documentationUrl": "https://docs.proposalforge.com/api/migration/v1-to-v2"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Migration Period**: Allow at least 6 months for clients to migrate to new versions

## Implementation Strategy

### API Gateway Configuration

The API Gateway routes requests based on the version in the URL path:

```
/v1/* → v1 API implementation
/v2/* → v2 API implementation
```

This allows different versions to coexist with separate implementations.

### Code Organization

API versions are organized in the codebase as follows:

```
/src
  /api
    /v1
      /controllers
      /routes
      /validators
      /transformers
    /v2
      /controllers
      /routes
      /validators
      /transformers
    /common
      /models
      /services
      /utils
```

Common functionality is shared between versions, with version-specific implementations where needed.

### Database Compatibility

The database schema is designed to support multiple API versions simultaneously:

1. **Additive Schema Changes**: New features add columns or tables rather than modifying existing ones
2. **View-Based Abstraction**: Database views can provide version-specific representations
3. **Migration Scripts**: Scripts handle data transformations when schema changes are unavoidable

### Feature Flags

Feature flags are used to manage the transition between versions:

1. **Implementing New Features**: New functionality is developed behind feature flags
2. **Testing in Production**: New versions can be tested with limited users before full release
3. **Gradual Rollout**: New versions can be gradually rolled out to minimize risk

## Versioning Timeline for ProposalForge

### Initial Release (MVP)

- **v1**: Initial API version supporting core functionality
  - Single-user operations
  - Document management
  - Proposal outlines and sections
  - AI-assisted content generation

### Enterprise Release

- **v1**: Enhanced with Enterprise features behind feature flags
  - Collaborative editing (feature flagged)
  - Multi-user permissions (feature flagged)
  - Advanced analytics (feature flagged)

### Future Major Versions

- **v2**: Potential future version with enhanced collaboration features
  - Real-time collaboration APIs
  - Enhanced permission model
  - Organizational hierarchy

## Client-Side Implementation

### Version Selection

Clients should specify which API version to use:

```javascript
// Frontend API client configuration
const apiClient = new ApiClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.proposalforge.com',
  version: 'v1', // API version to use
});
```

### Version Detection

Clients can detect available versions through the API:

```
GET /api-versions
```

Response:
```json
{
  "versions": [
    {
      "version": "v1",
      "status": "active",
      "lastUpdated": "2023-01-15",
      "sunset": null
    },
    {
      "version": "v2",
      "status": "preview",
      "lastUpdated": "2023-06-01",
      "sunset": null
    }
  ],
  "latest": "v1",
  "recommended": "v1"
}
```

### Version-Specific Documentation

Each API version has dedicated documentation:

- v1: https://docs.proposalforge.com/api/v1
- v2: https://docs.proposalforge.com/api/v2

The documentation includes:
- Complete API reference
- Migration guides
- Deprecation notices
- Sample code

## Version Support Policy

### Support Timeframes

- **Active Versions**: Fully supported with bug fixes and security updates
- **Deprecated Versions**: Security updates only, minimum 12-month migration period
- **Retired Versions**: No longer available or supported

### Extended Support

For Enterprise customers, extended support for deprecated versions may be available under specific agreements.

## Monitoring and Analytics

To inform versioning decisions, we track:

1. **Version Usage**: Monitoring which clients use which versions
2. **Endpoint Usage**: Identifying the most and least used endpoints
3. **Error Rates**: Tracking errors by version and endpoint
4. **Performance Metrics**: Measuring response times and throughput by version

This data guides prioritization for new versions and identifies when older versions can be retired.

## Communication Strategy

### Version Release Communications

When releasing new versions:

1. **Advance Notice**: Minimum 3-month notice before major version release
2. **Documentation**: Complete documentation available before public release
3. **Blog Posts**: Detailed explanation of new features and migration guidance
4. **Deprecation Notices**: Clear timelines for deprecated functionality
5. **Direct Communication**: Email notifications to registered API users

### In-Product Notifications

The ProposalForge dashboard includes:

1. **Version Status Indicators**: Current API version status
2. **Migration Wizards**: Tools to help migrate to newer versions
3. **Deprecation Warnings**: Notices when using deprecated features

## Conclusion

This versioning strategy provides a framework for evolving the ProposalForge API while maintaining reliability for clients. By following these guidelines, we can introduce new capabilities without disrupting existing integrations, ensuring a smooth transition from MVP to Enterprise and beyond.

The success of this strategy depends on:
- Careful planning of changes
- Clear communication with stakeholders
- Disciplined implementation of versioning mechanisms
